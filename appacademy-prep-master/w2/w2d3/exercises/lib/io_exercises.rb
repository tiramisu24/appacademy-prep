# # require "random"

# # * Write a `guessing_game` method. The computer should choose a number between
# #   1 and 100. Prompt the user to `guess a number`. Each time through a play loop,
# #   get a guess from the user. Print the number guessed and whether it was `too
# #   high` or `too low`. Track the number of guesses the player takes. When the
# #   player guesses the number, print out what the number was and how many guesses
# #   the player needed.
# # * Write a program that prompts the user for a file name, reads that file,
# #   shuffles the lines, and saves it to the file "{input_name}-shuffled.txt". You
# #   could create a random number using the Random class, or you could use the
# #   `shuffle` method in array.
